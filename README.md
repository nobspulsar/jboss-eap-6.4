# JBoss EAP as a container 

Only requirement to run this container is to add the binaries for JBoss EAP (and possible patches) to the corresponding folders

```
Default user: jboss
Default password: Passw0rd!
```
This can be changed by supplying the following environment variables to docker run
```
JBOSS_USER=jboss
JBOSS_PASSWORD=Passw0rd!
```
